# joint-cascade-face-detection-and-alignment

This project is a C++ reimplementation of joint cascade face detection and alignment in the ECCV 2014 

This project start with the code from https://github.com/yulequan/face-alignment-in-3000fps

I do not make sure the implementation is right, but in my experiment, i get the right face with right keypoints.

Only the Key codes were placed here Now.  

To be continued.
